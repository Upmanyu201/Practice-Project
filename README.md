# 👨‍💻 BlackArch's Python Projects

Welcome to my Python project portfolio — a growing collection of tools, utilities, and applications built as part of my journey to becoming a **professional Python developer** and cybersecurity specialist.

## 🧭 Current Focus

I'm actively learning and building with:

- ✅ Python Core (OOP, file I/O, error handling)
- ✅ CLI Tools with `argparse`
- ✅ JSON/CSV-based data managers
- ✅ Modular and testable architecture
- ✅ GUI with Tkinter
- ✅ Flask Web Development
- 🔄 Unit testing (`unittest`)
- 🔒 Cybersecurity (Python automation for analysis and tools)
